# Flow-Control-in-Python



# If statements:
        Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:
        Equals: a == b
        Not Equals: a != b
        Less than: a < b
        Less than or equal to: a <= b
        Greater than: a > b
        Greater than or equal to: a >= b


a = 33
b = 200
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")



# .

  a = 20
if a>0:
  print("Its Positive")


# .

n = 10
if n % 2 == 0:
   print("n is an even number")



# else statements:



a = 20
b = 10
c = 15
if a > b:
   if a > c:
      print("a value is big")
   else:
       print("c value is big")
elif b > c:
    print("b value is big")
else:
     print("c is big")




# Elif:
     The elif keyword is Python's way of saying "if the previous conditions were not true, then try this condition".



a = 33
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")




# .

a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")

# Nested if statement example

 # FOR LOOP:
         . A "For loop" is used to repeat a specific block of code a Known no. of Times.




# Print each fruit in a fruit list:



fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)




# Loop through the letters in the word "banana":

for x in "banana":
  print(x)



# Exit the loop when x is "banana":

fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  print(x)
  if x == "banana":
    break




 # Exit the loop when x is "banana", but this time the break comes before the print:




fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for x in fruits:
  if x == "banana":
    break
  print(x)

languages = ['Swift', 'Python', 'Go']

# access elements of the list one by one
for i in languages:
    print(i)



# iterate from i = 0 to i = 3

for i in range(4):
    print(i)





# While loop ---
          • while loop will run a Piece of code while a condition is True.
          • it is based on a boolean condition.




# Count 1 to 100:


x = 1

# if the user enters 5, the program will calculate and print the sum of the first 5 natural numbers:

n = int(input("Enter the number:"))
sum = 0

while i<=n:
  sum = sum+i
  i = i+1
print(sum)



# the user to enter a name until the entered name is "Dhoni". Once "Dhoni" is entered, the loop exits, and "Coool" is printed:

#  using nested loops to iterate over all combinations of i and j values from 0 to 3:

# infinite while loop:


age = 32

# the test condition is always True
while age > 18:
    print('You can vote')





# Transfer Statement:-

# Break (A break Statement, when used inside the loop, Terminate the loop & exits.)
# Continue (continue keyword is used to end of the current loop, and continues to the next.)
# Pass (The pass Keyword represents a null operations in Python.), (it is generally used for the purpose of Filling empty blocks of code.)
